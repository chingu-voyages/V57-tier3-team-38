## Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please follow these guidelines to help us maintain a high-quality codebase and workflow.

### Branch Naming Conventions

Please use the following branch naming patterns for your work:

- **New Features:**
	- `feature/add-toolbar` (e.g., for adding a new toolbar)
- **Bug Fixes:**
	- `bugfix/fix-login-error` (e.g., for fixing a login error)
- **Hotfixes (Urgent Production Fixes):**
	- `hotfix/critical-crash` (e.g., for urgent fixes in production)
- **Chores (Maintenance Tasks):**
	- `chore/update-dependencies` (e.g., for updating dependencies)
- **Documentation:**
	- `docs/add-contributing-guide` (e.g., for adding or updating documentation)

### Branching Strategy

- All new work must branch from `dev`.
- Feature branches should follow the naming conventions (e.g., `feature/add-toolbar`).
- Pull requests are merged into `dev` after review.
- At the end of each week, `dev` is merged into `main` to promote tested changes.


### How to Contribute

1. **Add a new branch** and create your branch from `dev`.
2. **Follow the branch naming conventions** above.
3. **Write clear, concise commit messages.**
4. **Test your changes** before submitting a pull request.
5. **Open a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.
6. **Link related issues** in your pull request if applicable.

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and linting rules.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `dev` before submitting a PR.
2. Address any review comments promptly.
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged by a maintainer.

### Reporting Issues
